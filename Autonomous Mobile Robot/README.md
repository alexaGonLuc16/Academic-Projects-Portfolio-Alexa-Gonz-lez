# Autonomous Navigation Robot
**Duration:** Feb – Jun 2025

## Project Overview
This AI and robotics project focuses on optimized autonomous navigation for a mobile robot in a simulated traffic track. The track includes traffic lights, speed control signs, and intersections. The robot is designed to detect and respond to these elements while following a path efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8**: Traffic lights and sign detection  
- **Roboflow**: Image dataset creation and preprocessing  
- **ROS 2 (Python)**: System framework and robot integration  
- **Puzzlebot**: Mobile robot with Nvidia Jetson Nano and Hackerboard  
- **Control Methods**: P controller for line following; experiments with fuzzy logic for decision-making  

## Project Description
The project was developed in collaboration with **Manchester Robotics** using ROS 2 and the Puzzlebot platform. Key functionalities include:  
- Optimized path planning for autonomous navigation  
- Detection of intersections and traffic signs  
- Integration of traffic light recognition for dynamic decision-making  
- Line-following using P control with optional fuzzy logic enhancements  

This project demonstrates how AI-based perception and control methods can be combined to enable efficient, real-time autonomous navigation in complex environments.
