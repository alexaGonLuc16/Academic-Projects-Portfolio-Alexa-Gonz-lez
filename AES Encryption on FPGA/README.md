# AES Encryption on FPGA (Intel)

## Overview
This project focuses on the hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm on an Intel FPGA platform using VHDL. The main objective was to design an efficient, modular, and high-performance encryption architecture suitable for resource-constrained and real-time systems.

The project was developed as part of an academic initiative and formally presented to Intel.

## Project Objectives
- Implement the AES encryption algorithm in hardware using VHDL
- Design a modular architecture for AES rounds and key expansion
- Optimize performance and hardware resource utilization
- Validate the design through simulation.

## Technical Approach
The AES algorithm was implemented following a structured hardware design methodology. The architecture was divided into functional modules corresponding to the main AES operations, enabling scalability and efficient data flow.

Emphasis was placed on:
- Parallelism and pipeline-friendly design
- Efficient use of FPGA resources
- Deterministic execution suitable for real-time applications

## Technologies and Tools
- VHDL
- Intel FPGA development tools
